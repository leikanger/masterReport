\section{Artificial Neural Systems : A Review of ANN History}
	\label{ssecHistoryOfANN}
	The pragmatic use neural network simulations started with the ``McCulloch--Pitts neuron'' in 1943.
	%Warren McCulloch, an early neuroscientist and the young mathematician Walter Pitts formalized the models of the neuron and proposed the first artificial neuron simulator. %artificial neural network.
	Warren McCulloch, an early neuroscientist and the young mathematician Walter Pitts initiated a formalized discussion about the mechanics of the neuron and the use of neuron simulations in technology. %artificial neural network.
	This resulted in the first neuron emulator(artificial neuron). %, later referred to as the McCulloch--Pitts neuron. 
	%When a network of nodes consisting of the artificial neural was set up, McCulloch and Pitts created the very first artificial neural network(ANN).\cite{MccullochPittsHistorie} %TODO Sjekk referansen! TODO

	Artificial Neural Networks based on the McCulloch--Pitts neuron model has later been referred to as the first generation ANN\cite{Maass97networksof}.
	%What has later been referred to as the first generation ANN is based on the McCulloch--Pitts neuron\cite{Maass97networksof}.
	%One example of a first generation ANN is the Rosenblatt's Preceptron\cite{HaykinANNbok}.
	Each node is modelled as a boolean device(with an on--off response), where the node sends output if the immediate input level is large enough.
	The first generation ANN can therefore be said to be a network of simple threshold gates, %filters called threshold gates.
		and does not take into consideration the depolarization state of each node. %, and is a tremendous simplification of the biological neuron.
	%This does not take into consideration the depolarization (state) of each node, and is a tremendous simplification of the biological neuron.
	%The first generation ANN thus does not take into consideration the depolarization of the neuron, and is a great simplification of the biological neuron.
	One famous example of an ANN classified as a first generation ANN is Rosenblatt's Perceptron\cite{HaykinANNbok}.

\end{figure}

	The second generation ANN gives a better simulation of the neuron. % in the frequency domain.
	%A better simulation of the neuron considers the neuron in the frequency domain.
	Each node computes the output level as a floating point number based on the immediate input to the node.
	From sec. \ref{secBiologicalNeuralSystems}, the biological neuron is introduced as a node that sends output when the depolarization goes to suprathreshold levels.
	A continuous propagation of a floating point number can therefore be said to represent the frequency of such transmissions as a function of present input.
%%%
	The function used for computing the output is referred to as the \emph{activation function} of the node, and is found to give the best results if it is given by the continuously differentiable sigmoid function\cite{HaykinANNbok}.

	As the biological neuron has a state that gives the depolarization value of the neuron, the stateless computation in the McCulloch--Pitts neuron is gross simplification of the original system.
	It could be more correct to consider the neuron as being stateless in the frequency domain, and the stateless computation of a second generation ANN can be said to be more correct than in a first generation ANN.
	%Because it is more right to consider the neuron as stateless in the frequency domain, the stateless computation in a second generation ANN is more correct than the stateless computation in the McCulloch--Pitts neuron model.
	As the concept of frequency only makes sense for time intervals of a certain size, precise simulations with small computational time steps does not necessarily give accurate simulation results for an ANN of the second generation.

% 	To summarize this section about ANN history, there are three generations of artificial neural networks, each getting closer to the biological neuron in behaviour.
% 	%What propagates thought the network, how this is computed and what it represents differs  
% 	The first generation of artificial neurons where so--called threshold gates, with a boolean output that was [true] if the summed input were above some threshold. %TODO CITE!
% 	Nodes of the second generation gave, in some respects, a better simulation of the biological neuron.
% 	The output is not given as discrete states given by the input but as a continuous function that can be interpreted as the firing frequency of the node. % of the level of input to the node.
% 	With this interpretation it can be said that ANNs of this generation gives a simulation that is closer to the biological neuron in behaviour.
% 	%If the transmission through the output synapse of a neuron is seen as the firing frequency of that neuron, it can be said that this generation of ANN gives a simulation that is closer to the biological neuron.
% 	%The third generation ANN is supposed to be an accurate simulation of the neuron, and is as close to the biological neuron as possible.
% 	The third generation ANN is supposed to give an accurate simulation of the neuron, and achieves this by simulation the neuron's depolarization directly. 
% 	The neuron has an internal state representing the depolarization and fires if this value goes to supra--threshold levels.
% 	The signal is propagated in the same manner as in the biological neuron, where excitatory synapses increase the postsynaptic depolarization and inhibitory synapses decrease the postsynaptic depolarization.
% 	%Errors in the simulation comes as a consequence of numerical errors or from the neuron model used.
% 	Because the nodes of a SANN is a direct simulation of the mechanisms involved in the neuron's depolarization, only numerical errors and errors in the neuron model used separates the simulation results from the behaviour of a real neuron.

%It is actually so close that the word ``simulation'' will occasionally be used in this report.  	% ".. actually so closa that .." DÅRLIG. Fiks?

%In the third generation ANN it is the action potentials or the "spikes", that is responsible for information processing.  %TODO Skriv om slutten / Feil ord.. 		".. or the "spikes" that is responsible for the information flow.
%This ANN model is therefore often referred to as ``Spiking Artificial Neural Network''(SANN).

%If the transmissions between nodes is viewed as the firing frequency of the neuron, we can say that the continuous output value represents the output frequency as a function of the input frequency over the time step in the simulation.

%The nodes of the third generation ANN became even more similar to the biological neuron, as the output of a node depend solely on the state of the node.

	A node in a SANN is a simulation of the neuron's depolarization.
	When the depolarization level crosses the firing threshold from below, a spike is initiated and the signal is propagated.
	Many formal spiking neuron models exist, where the most common is the $LIF$ neuron model\cite{florian03}. %TODO Sjekk om dette står der!
%	Many formal spiking neuron models exist, but we will in this text focus on the Leaky Integrate--and--Fire(LIF) neuron.

	The $LIF$ model is a simple phenomenological model of the biological neuron, and is highly popular due to its simplicity.
	%The neuron's depolarization is simulated by numerical integration of all membrane--potential changing input, including leakage.
	%A basic electrical $RC$ circuit, consisting of a resistance in parallel with a capacitor can be used as an analogy to explain the $LIF$ model.
	%The driving current $I_{tot}(t)$ can be split into two components, $I_R(t)$ that represents the current that ``leaks'' through the resistance and the input current $I_{input}(t)$\cite{gerstnerKistler2002KAP04}. 
	The leaky integration of the $LIF$ neuron can be modelled by the electrical circuit shown in fig. \ref{figRCcircuitAvNeuronet}.
	When the membrane potential $v(t)$ crosses the neuron's firing threshold $\tau$, a spike is initiated causing transmissions through all the neuron's output synapses.
	The neuron's membrane potential is then reset to the resting membrane potential $v_r<\tau$ \cite{gerstnerKistler2002KAP04}.
