	%In the late 1800s, Camillo Golgi developed a way of staining nervous tissue so that complex networks of nerve cells (neurons) became apperent.
	Santiago Ramon Y Cajal used Golgi's technique in such a way that individual neurons could be separated, and it was observed that nervous tissue was not a continuous web but a network of discrete cells. 
	He proposed what has later been known as the neuron doctrine; That the basis of intelligence is individual ``brain cells'' that can process incoming transmissions and 
		can send output transmissions as a consequence of receiving enough depolarizing input transmissions.
	For their contribution, Ramon Y Cajal and Golgi shared the 1906 Nobel's price in Physiology and Medicine.

	Modern neuroscience follows the neuron doctrine. 
	Each node in a neural network is called a neuron and the connection between neurons are called synapses.
	When the presynaptic neuron ``fires'' an action potential, the following synaptic transmission cause the postsynaptic neuron to become excited or inhibited.
	%All synapses have direction(propagates information in one direction) and transmits if the presynaptic neuron ``fires'' an action potential.
	%Synapses can be exitatory or inhibitory.
	Transmissions in excitatory synapses increase the postsynaptic membrane potential, causing that neuron to approach firing. %sending an action potential.
	Inhibitory transmissions does the opposite, and inhibits the postsynaptic neuron with respect to firing.

	\subsection{The Axon and the Action Potential}

		Voltage--gated sodium and potassium channels are located along the membrane of the axon.
		If the membrane potential is more positive than the ``firing threshold'' of the neuron, these channels open, causing the membrane to have a transient positive increase in membrane potential.
		%In the membrane of the axon there are voltage--gated sodium and potassium channels that open if the level of depolarization is more than some value, referred to as the ``firing threshold'' of the neuron.
%This value is referred to as the ``firing threshold'' of the neuron.
		%When these channels are activated, the membrane potential will transiently have a large positive increase in membrane potential.
		Through passive transmission of the electrical charge due to diffusion of ions, the membrane potential at the next site of voltage gated channels becomes more positive than the firing threshold and the process is repeated.
%TODO Skriv om: neste setning!
		The size of the signal arriving at the axon terminal at the end of the axon is thus independent of the total distance traveled.
		%The signal propagates actively to the end of the axon(the axon terminal); 	The size of the signal arriving at an axon terminal is independent of the travelling distance.
		%The process is repeated, and the active propagation of the action potential continues until the end of the axon(the axon terminal).
		\cite{PrinciplesOfNeuralScience4edKAP09}
%%%Through passive transmission of the electrical potential, the next voltage gated channels will open as a result of going above the gate threshold. 
		%This establishes the active aspect of action potential propagation, and results in a self carrying propagating through the axon.
		%T0DO CITE: \cite{PrinciplesOfNeuralScience4edKAP09}.


		The two most important voltage gated channels for the active part of action potential propagation are the sodium and the potassium channels.
		%The $Na^{2+}$ channel is more responsive than the $K^+$ channel, and enables the $Na^{2+}$ ion that has the highest concentration outside the cell to flow into the cell.
		%This cause the membrane potential to become more positive.
		The $Na^{2+}$ channel is most responsive and enables the $Na^{2+}$ ion to flow freely. %, that has the highest concentration outside the cell, to flow into the cell.

		The potassium ion has the highest concentration inside the cell, and activation of the $K^+$ channel cause a flow of positively charged ions out of the cell, repolarizing the neuron.
		%This cause the neuron to repolarize after firing, as can be seen in fig. \ref{figActionPotential}.
		Because the $K^+$ channel is slightly less responsive than the $Na^{2+}$ channel, and that both channels only stay open for a short while,

		To sum up this section, it can be said that the computational capability of a single neuron does not extend very far.
		It can be modelled as a basic leaky integrator of input, where the value represents the electrochemical potential over the neuronal membrane.
		%In biology, this is possible because of the 
% 		%%
		The signalling capabilities of the neuron is possible because of the phospholipid bilayer, that is virtually impermeable to electrically charged ions and molecules.
		This enables an electrochemical potential over the membrane, and the neuron can have a rapidly changing state.
		In terms from graph theory, the synapse is a directed weighted edge, where the weight is plastic.
		%In terms from graph theory, the synapse is a directed edge with a plastic weight.
		%In terms from graph theory, the synapse is a weighted directed edge between two nodes.
		The chemical synapse therefore enables transmissions from presynaptic neurons to be amplified or reduced depending on the size of the synaptic connection.

		The neuron fires an action potential when the membrane potential of the neuron becomes more positive than the firing threshold.
		An action potential is a self--carrying signal that enables output synapses all along the axon to receive the same intracellular signal, causing the size of synaptic transmission to be given solely by the synaptic weight.
		The distance between the start of the axon and the synapse does not reduce the size of the signal, but it does introduce a small delay given by the distance travelled.
		% This delay is important because of the Spike--Time Dependent Plasticity that increase 
		This delay is thought to be important, as Spike--Time Dependent Plasticity states that the synaptic weight of a synapse can increase or decrease depending on the time of transmission.

		The computational capabilities of neural networks is a result of having a tremendous amount of these weak computational units.
		In the human brain, the number of neurons is estimated to have an order of magnitude corresponding to about $10^{11}$ nodes, each estimated to have about $10^3$ input synapses.
		%Every neuron is excitable and fires an action potential 
		Every neuron is excitable and every synapse is plastic based on e.g. the relative time of firing of the presynaptic and the postsynaptic neuron.
		%This creates a highly parallel system that is hard to simulate.
