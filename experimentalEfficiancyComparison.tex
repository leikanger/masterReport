% 		If all nodes are updated each time step, the computational load scale linearly with the number of nodes and the inverse of the size of the computational time step.
% 		By halving the size of the computational time step, the computational load increase as if the number of nodes are doubled.
% 		By having precise simulation algorithms, fewer time iterations can be utilized to accomplish the same accuracy for the simulation.
% 		This explains that the accuracy of simulation algorithms can be used as a good measure of efficiency, and establish the motivation for having precise simulation algorithms.
% 		More sophisticated numerical integration techniques are therefore often used to accomplish a high accuracy in numerical simulations\cite{PlesserStraubeMorrisonPlesser2007}.





	To compare the accuracy of the two simulation models, low--resolution simulations of $\kappa M$ and $NIM$ can be compared to a simulation with much higher temporal resolution. %smaller time steps. % higher temporal resolution.
	In this work, the low--resolution simulations have less than $1000$ time steps per forcing function period, while the high--resolution $NIM$ simulation has $1.000.000$ time steps per period.
%	In this work, the low--resolution simulations have less than $1000$ time steps per forcing function period, while the high--resolution $NIM$ simulation has a resolution of $1.000.000$ time steps per period.

	The simulated solution has a number of time steps that is more than three orders of magnitude larger than for the low--resolution simulations.

	To make the experiments as comparable and reproducible as possible, the behaviour of a single node is simulated for the two simulation models.
	This node is implemented as a sensory node that receives depolarizing input defined by an externally applied signal $\xi_i(t_n)$. 
	For the sake of reproducibility, algebraic functions are utilized for all experiments in this work.
	For details on the design and implementation of the sensory node, see appendix \ref{appendixSensoryNode}.

	\subsection{Experiment 1: Idealized Situation}
	First consider an idealized situation, with a constant depolarizing inflow.
	This can be implemented as a sensory neuron with a forcing function $\xi(t_n)=1.1 \tau$. 
	This simple input flow simplifies analysis and shows whether the theory presented in chapter \ref{chDevelopmentOfANovelModel} can be used to simulate the neuron.

	This experiment can be used to assess whether the concept of \emph{time windows} and \emph{intra--iteration time resolution} works as designed.
	The concept of \emph{time windows} can be examined, since the activation level $\kappa$ is ``changed'' to the same value every time step.
	Each time $\kappa$ is changed, a new \emph{time window} is initialized and a new estimate for the next firing time is computed.
	This also enables an analysis of whether proactive firing time scheduling can be used to simulate the neuron's firing: %works as intended.
		If the spike is delayed as a result of having a time grid of possible spike times, the simulation error will have a step from before to after the spike.
	The concept of intra--iteration time accuracy therefore works as intended if the error after a spike is a linear continuation of the error curve before the spike.
	To make the effect observable in plots of the neuron's depolarization, a temporal resolution of only $100$ time steps is chosen for experiment 1.

	Because of the simple sensory function, the exact solution can be computed for the neuron's spike times.
	Experiment 1 can therefore be used to assess the accuracy of a simulation, up to a very high precision.
	This enables an analysis of the simulated solution's error, and a discussion of when it can be considered to be the correct solution for accuracy comparisons.
%	This enables an analysis of the simulated solution's error, and a discussion of when it can be considered to be the correct solution for later experiments.
% 	This enables an analysis of the simulated solution's error, and whether the presumption that it can be considered the solution holds.  %, and the error of the simulated solution can be analyzed.


	\subsection{Experiment 2: More Realistic Input Flow}
	\label{ssecExperiment2Design}
	Section \ref{ssecAnalysisOfErrorsForTheTwoModels} concludes  that the $\kappa M$ error is a result of the delay between an altered depolarizing flow and the initiation of a new \emph{time window}. %and the next computational time step.
	This implies that the error is constant for a constant forcing function.
	When designing an experiment for assessing the efficiency of the two simulation models, the form of the input should preferably affect both simulation models equally. 
	The best way to achieve this is to consider a forcing function where neither the value nor the derivative of any order is constant.
 
	Let the forcing function be defined by a trigonometric function that gives an activation level corresponding to $\kappa$ being above the firing threshold for the whole simulation.
	When $\kappa < \tau$, the simulated depolarization has the possibility to level out at a subthreshold value, suppressing the simulation error. 
% 	When $\kappa < \tau$, the artificial neuron's depolarization has the possibility to level out at a subthreshold value, suppressing the simulation error. 
	This is avoided to make the error from the two simulation models prominent. % in the experiment.
% 	This is avoided to make the error more prominent for the two simulations.
	The forcing function in experiment 2 is defined to be
\begin{equation}
	f(t) = (2.1 + sin\left(2\pi \cdot \frac{t_n}{l}\right)) \cdot \tau % TODO ER DENNE RETT? Sjekk!
	\label{eqSensorFunction}
\end{equation}
	where $l$ defines the temporal resolution of the simulation.
% 	This constant can be set by running $auroSim$ with the argument $-r[\text{temp.res.}]$.
%%
	%The neuron was simulated over one and a half period of \eqref{eqSensorFunction}, to enable a comparison of the error for the same phase of the forcing function.
% 	This is achieved by sending the argument $-n[\text{number of periods}]$ to \emph{auroSim}. %, and is done to find if there is any accumulation of error in simulations utilizing the two models. %for the two models.

	\section{Discussion of Experimental Results}

		The primary motivation for the first experiment is to assess whether the theory discussed in chapter \ref{chDevelopmentOfANovelModel} makes it possible to implement a spiking neuron simulator based on synaptic flow.
		%%
		The concept of time windows, as defined in sec. \ref{ssecTheAlgebraicSolution}, enables the use of the algebraic solution for simulation of the neuron's depolarization. 
		In the implementation used in this work, a new time window is initiated every computational time step, making it irrelevant whether the activation level is constant or dynamic. 
		This makes the results from experiment 1 pertinent for error analysis. 

		The simple form of the neuron's forcing function in the first experiment enables a precise error analysis for the its spike times.
		It is possible to compute the neuron's firing times algebraically, enabling an analysis of the simulated solution's error.
		The simulated solution has a cumulative error that increases with up to one computational time step for every spike, given this level of input.
%%%%%%%%
		In a simulation with only $26$ spikes, this gives a maximum spike time error for the simulated solution, $f_{e, max} = \frac{26}{1000000} = 2.6\cdot10^{-5}$. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 			%%						%%				%%									%			%$f_{e, max} = \frac{26}{1500000} = 1.73\cdot10^{-5}$. 
		Thus, in experiment 2, the theoretical maximum spike time error for the simulated solution is much smaller than the computational time step in both low--resolution simulations. %a simulation with a temporal resolution $l = 1.000$.
% ENTEN: Dei 2 over, eller den under:
%		Thus, in experiment 2, the theoretical maximum spike time error for the simulated solution is much smaller than the computational time step in a simulation with a temporal resolution $l = 1.000$.
		$$ \Delta t_{NIM,1.000} = \frac{1}{1000} = 10^{-3}$$
		This shows that the simulated solution can be considered to be the correct solution, up to an accuracy defined by the low--resolution simulation with finest granularity, $NIM_{1.000}$.
%		This shows that the simulated solution can be considered to be the correct solution, up to an accuracy defined by the low--resolution simulation with the finest temporal resolution, $NIM_{1.000}$.
%%%%%%%%%
% 		Since the temporal resolution for the simulated solution is more than $1.000$ times more than that of the low--resolution simulations, this is considered to be an acceptable error for a simulation with only $26$ spikes. %error is acceptable for a simulation with only $26$ spikes.

	%In the second part of experiment 2, where the experiment is simulated over a time interval that gives $228$ spikes for the neuron, a $NIM_{100.000.000}$ simulation is used to find the simulated solution.


 
		Experiment 2 considers a sinusoidal input flow corresponding to an activation level that varies between $1.1\tau$ and $3.1\tau$.
		Since the forcing function has the property that no aspect of the signal is constant in the time domain, 
			the results from experiment 2 is more valid for an efficiency analysis than experiment 1.
		The experiment shows that the $\kappa M_{100}$ simulation generally is more accurate than the $NIM_{1.000}$ simulation.
%		The experiment shows that the  $\kappa M_{100}$ simulation generally produce an error of smaller magnitude than that of the $NIM_{1.000}$ simulation. %, in the course of the simulation.

%  		This effect is larger when the same experiment is simulated over a time interval that is ten times as long.
		The absolute error becomes larger in the $NIM_{10.000}$ simulation than in the $\kappa M_{100}$ simulation before the simulation is over.
		This implies a considerable efficiency improvement, since the $NIM$ simulation utilizes a number of time steps that is two orders of magnitude larger than the $\kappa M$ simulation.
