A simulator implemented by numerical integration of input involves an accumulation of truncation errors, because the error is integrated as well as the value.
%Because the depolarization of a neuron is integrated up to the firing threshold before it is reset and starts depolarizing from the membrane resting potential(that is less than the firing threshold), 
%	the depolarization can be said to have a rising phase of unlimited length.
The depolarization of a neuron is integrated up to the firing threshold, before an action potential is fired and the depolarization is reset to the resting membrane potential.
Because the resting membrane potential always is less than the firing threshold, one can say that the depolarization have a rising phase of unlimited length. % for simuleringer der t->infty.

It can be argued that any systematic local truncation error therefore cause an error of unbounded size as time $t_n\to\infty$.

% 	The two simulations models mentioned in this text have been designed from scratch, and implemented in a common framework to enable a better comparison.
% 	In the preliminary project to this MS thesis, the two simulations models were compared theoretically.
% 	The analysis was supported by the design and implementation of the two models from scrach.
% 	The two models are therefore implemented using a common framework, where the the subelements of a neuron for the two models are inherited from a common ancestor class.
