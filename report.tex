\chapter{Background Theory}
	Before introducing the considered spiking neuron simulation models, a minimal of background theory has to be introduced.
	This chapter is reserved for this purpose, and starts by introducing the most important aspects of neural signal processing mechanics.
	After the biological neuron has been introduced, artificial neural systems(neural simulations) is introduced.
	Section \ref{secSpikingANNBackgroundInfo} goes through the history of Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs) and finally the artificial neuron model that carry out a direct simulation of the neuron's depolarization.

	This chapter is intended to introduce the reader to the necessary background information to make the theory in this work comprehensible.
	It is recommended that the reader utilize this chapter as a reference work when the considered spiking ANN models are presented and analyzed.

	\chapter{Efficiency; Experimental Comparison} %Mesurements}
	\label{chExperimentalEfficiencyMeasurement}
		The primary motivation behind a simulator is to produce accurate simulation results.
		%The goal of a simulator is to produce accurate simulation results of to the neuron model used.
		As introduced in section \ref{ssecAnalysisOfErrorsForTheTwoModels}, the simulation error of a neural simulator can be minimized by letting the temporal resolution be fine.
		This also greatly increases the computational load of the simulation, as more computations have to be conducted for the same simulated time domain.
		A relative efficiency comparison can therefore be performed by comparing the accuracy of two simulations for a given temporal resolution, or the resolution needed to accomplish the same accuracy.
		%A good measure of efficiency can therefore be the accuracy of the simulation model for a given temporal resolution or the relative temporal resolution needed to accomplish the same accuracy.
		%One measure of efficiency can therefore be the accuracy of the given simulation model for a given temporal resolution or the relative temporal resolution needed to accomplish the same accuracy.

		%The computational complexity of $\kappa M$, as discussed in section \ref{ssecOnComputationalComlexity} give large requirements for the novel model.
		Because the run time of the $\kappa M$ simulation in sec. \ref{ssecOnComputationalComlexity} was almost the double of the $NIM$ simulation, large requirements are lain upon the novel model.
		% for it to be as efficient at the $NIM$ model.
		If the hypothesized accuracy improvement is large enough, $\kappa M$ can still be as efficient or even more efficient than the $NIM$ simulation model.
		%If the simulation produce the hypothesized accuracy improvement, it might still be as efficient of even more efficient than the $NIM$ simulation model.
		%The hypothesized stability property of the $\kappa M$ error might also be important in this context, and could show important for the global error after long simulations.
		The purpose of this chapter is to assess the comparative efficiency of the two models by considering the absolute simulation error of similar situations.



%		In digital simulations, where time is divided into discrete time steps, numerical errors comes as a consequence of having a bounded temporal accuracy. %TODO Cite ?




% The size of the truncation errors caused by the discretization of time can be minimized by letting the number of iterations be very large and the computational time step very small.
% This cause the discrete time to go toward continuous time, and the truncation errors to go toward zero. %and the error from simulating the system in discrete time to go toward zero.
% Because of this direct correlation between the size of the error and the computational load, it is possible to measure the efficiency of a simulator by the simulation error;
% 	For simulations with smaller error, larger computational time steps can be used to accomplish the same accuracy goal.
% In this work, the efficiency of the two models are analyzed by comparing the simulation error of a $\kappa M$ and a $NIM$ simulation of low temporal resolution with a high resolution $NIM$ simulation. % with over $1000$ times the number of time steps.
% %The results from this high--resolution simulation will be referred to as the simulated solution in the remainder of this text. %, and considered the true time course.

% In this work, the simulated solution have a high temporal resolution of $1.000.000$ time steps per sensory function period. %, the simulation takes long time to complete.
% The simulation produce results with small error, but is very inefficient.
% The high--resolution simulation's depolarization time course is considered the true time course, and referred to as the simulated solution in the remainder of this text.
% The results from low--resolution simulations with a temporal resolution of $100$ or $1000$ can therefore be compared to the depolarization of the simulated solution to find the accuracy of the two models, $\kappa M$ and $NIM$.
% %Because of the high accuracy of the simulated solution, it is considered the correct depolarization curve for the $LIF$ neuron for the experiments conducted in this work.
